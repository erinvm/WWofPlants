# The Wonderful World of Plants
---

This app was developed to support users in their garden decision making process when selecting appropriate plants for their environment. The app allows users to input a variety of variables that may be desirable attributes or necessary limitations of potential plants. Thy are then given a list of (no more than 30 items at this time) of plants that meet their inputs.

## Getting Started
Besides a secrets document for a unique Trefle API key, and the python packages listed below, all necessary files can be found within this Git repository.

### Prerequisites: 
Users of this app will need the following packages
* flask
* sqlite3
* requests

A Trefle API key can be obtained [Here](https://trefle.io/). Import this into the app in a secrets module. 

## Built With:
This app was built using Flask to handle the UI.
